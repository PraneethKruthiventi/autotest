Histogram
---------

Histograms are used to determine the density of data.

Objective of this program is to read data from a file and find out the count of different attributes.
In the file the data might be repeated with changes in some of the attributes, then the updated data must be
considered in counting the number of attributes.
The format of the data is in the sample file attached in this folder, where you would find the different attributes.

The input will be the file and the output should be displayed with attribute name and the
count of that attribute.

For the histogram.txt in this directory here is the expected output:
